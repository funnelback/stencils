Build Specification Snippets
=================

This page contains shorts snippets which can be fed into the build specification document.

## Template files
**&lt; NOTE: This fits in the build specification v0.1 under 7.2.4 Template files&gt;**<br>
Funnelback uses templates to allow administrators to customise their search interface. It supports changes to the appearance of the search page, as well as advanced search and inclusion of metadata/XML fields in result summaries.
<br>
Classic UI templates are .form files and are served via IIS.  The Classic UI is accessed from http://cbr50es01p/search/search.cgi?collection=casa-internal&form=<FORMNAME>
<br>
Modern UI templates are .ftl (Freemarker) files and are served via Funnelbackâ€™s Jetty web server. The Modern UI is accessed from http://cbr50es01p:8080/s/search.html?collection=casa-internal&form=<FORMNAME>
<br>
<FORMNAME> is the name of the template.  Eg. for casa.form, casa.ftl replace <FORMNAME> with casa.
 form=<FORMNAME> can be omitted from the URL if using the simple.form/ftl template.
<br>
Template files can be edited from the administration interface. See: https://docs.funnelback.com/13.0/search_forms.html

## Faceted Navigation
**&lt; NOTE: This fits in the build specification v0.1 under 7.2.8 Faceted Navigation&gt;**<br>
<This is only required for collections that are queried>
Faceted navigation is presented for all search results.  The facets allow a user to filter the search results based on structured data present in the indexed content.  Facets currently defined are based on metadata values.
Further information on faceted navigation: https://docs.funnelback.com/13.0/faceted_navigation.html


| Facet | Data source | Description
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Facet - "Collection" | Gscope | Coresponds to the collection to which the item belongs (Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube.) |
| Sub Facet -"Facebook Type" | Metadata (stencilsFacebookType) | Facebook content type e.g Post, Event and Page.|
| Facet - "Author" | Metadata (a) |Content author.|
