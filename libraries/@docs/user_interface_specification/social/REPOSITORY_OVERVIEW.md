Repository overview
================

**&lt;Summarise the coverage.  Do not get bogged down in product-specific details â€“ this details the repositories NOT the collections.  This will often mirror the collection structure but there may be operational reasons why you wish to separate them. Eg.&gt;**<br>
The search will cover content from a number of repositories.  These repositories are a mixture of restricted and public access content.  The repositories will be fully crawled (where possible).<br>
