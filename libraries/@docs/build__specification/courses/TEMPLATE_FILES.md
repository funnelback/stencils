Template files
=====================

**&lt; NOTE: This fits in the build specification v0.1 under 7.2.4 Template files&gt;**<br>
Funnelback uses templates to allow administrators to customise their search interface. It supports changes to the appearance of the search page, as well as advanced search and inclusion of metadata/XML fields in result summaries.
<br>
Classic UI templates are .form files and are served via IIS.  The Classic UI is accessed from http://cbr50es01p/search/search.cgi?collection=casa-internal&form=<FORMNAME>
<br>
Modern UI templates are .ftl (Freemarker) files and are served via Funnelbackâ€™s Jetty web server. The Modern UI is accessed from http://cbr50es01p:8080/s/search.html?collection=casa-internal&form=<FORMNAME>
<br>
<FORMNAME> is the name of the template.  Eg. for casa.form, casa.ftl replace <FORMNAME> with casa.
 form=<FORMNAME> can be omitted from the URL if using the simple.form/ftl template.
<br>
Template files can be edited from the administration interface. See: https://docs.funnelback.com/13.0/search_forms.html
