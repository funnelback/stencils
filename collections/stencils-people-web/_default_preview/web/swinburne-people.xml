Prior to the commencement of his PhD, Till worked with &quot;Hidden Champion&quot;in the medical device industry in Germany. As a specialist for regulatory affairs and quality management, he was member of numerous product development projects from early stage until market launch, including international regulatory clearances. Till graduated in Engineering and Management in Germany which involved internships in the USA and France. PhD Project. PhD title: The evolution of innovation networks and the dynamics of proximity. Till’ s PhD project is focussed on understanding the determinants for the formation of innovation networks over time. By investigating the global adoption of a novel technology from CSIRO, as an example for the commercialisation of public research, he aims to understand the emergence of network structures in the form of collaborative ties which facilitate the flow of knowledge from research towards the marketplace. This will be implemented with a longitudinal research design using patent data for constructing a co-inventor network. The PhD focuses on the dynamic interplay of geography, the flow of knowledge and network structure. The PhD project is linked to the ARC Future Fellowship Project titled “ Complex Ties: Networks and the commercialisation of public research”.

Faculty of Business and Law. Swinburne Business School. Department of Leadership and Management. BSc(Hons), PhD (Monash). Tel: 61 3 9214 5984. Office: BA1021. Email: jvoros@swin.edu.au. Biography. Dr Joseph Voros holds a PhD in theoretical physics (on mathematical extensions to the General Theory of Relativity). He then spent several years in internet-related companies, including Netscape Communications Corporation, and is now a professional futurist. Dr Voros started at Swinburne in 2000 as a project consultant in the former Australian Foresight Institute. Then appointed as a strategic foresight analyst in a top-level strategic planning unit at Swinburne, he was involved in the building of an organisational strategic thinking capacity based on foresight concepts and methodologies, forming strong links with the strategic foresight teaching program, attending every subject and providing a practitioner&#39;s perspective in invited lectures. In 2003, he began lecturing in the Master of Strategic Foresight program on the theory and practice of foresight in organisations and society. Dr Voros also re-designed, convened and for several years taught the Master of Business Administration (MBA) unit on Corporate Strategy, bringing a unique foresight perspective to it. He has presented at conferences nationally and internationally, including keynotes, and three of his research articles have won excellence awards including an Outstanding Paper Award in 2010. He has a strong belief in the need for both rigorous intellectual discipline as well as practical pragmatic utility in &quot;real world&quot;contexts, and this belief lies at the heart of his approach to Futures Studies and strategic foresight. For many years he has used the multidisciplinary frameworks of Cosmic Evolution, Astrobiology, and &#39;Big History&#39;to frame and explore broad questions about the longer-term futures of global civilisation and humankind. He is a member of the World Futures Studies Federation, an academic member of the Big History Institute, a professional member of the World Future Society, and a founding member and current Board member of the International Big History Association. He serves on the editorial boards of the UK journal Foresight, the US Journal of Integral Theory and Practice, and the European Journal of Futures Research, and is an associate editor of the forthcoming Journal of Big History.

Dr Janine Muir is a Lecturer in Accounting at Swinburne University of Technology, specialising in Auditing, Forensic Accounting and Accounting Theory. She is a CPA qualified accountant with 15 years industry experience encompassing transport and logistics and publishing. Throughout her academic career Janine has been involved in curriculum development and delivery of undergraduate and post-graduate units both domestically and internationally. She designed and developed two new Swinburne units; one incorporating blended delivery and the other an online unit. Janine&#39;s research interests include accounting education, financial reporting, accounting regulation and compliance. Janine&#39;s PhD examined volunteer accounting in an unregulated environment, and considered the accounting and assurance functions pertaining to small incorporated associations in Victoria. Her examiners were Professor David Hay (Auckland University) and Associate Professor Anne Abraham (University of Western Sydney). In 2009/2010 Janine participated in an ALTC Project that examined the embedding of non-technical skills into the accounting curriculum, and was on a research team that examined the practice of &quot;learning by doing&quot;in 2012. Janine is currently working on multiple collaborative research projects: one looking at the development of judgment skills in undergraduate accounting students; and another looking at the concept and application of professional skepticism. Janine has also received a number of teaching awards - two Faculty level awards in 2012 and 2014 as well as being a finalist in the 2008 Unijobs &quot;Lecturer of the Year&quot;awards. Teaching.

Centre for Social Impact Swinburne. PhD (Social Gerontology) (LaT), MA (Ind Sociology) (Melb), BA (Hons) (PolSc) (Melb). Tel: 61 3 9214 5949. Office: Room 1, 14 Wakefield St, Hawthorn. Email: lbrooke@swin.edu.au. Biography. Dr Elizabeth Brooke is involved in researching the effects of the ageing global population on workforce demographics, policies and practices. Dr Brooke&#39;s research expertise has led to her participation in international projects, which bring together researchers in the field of ageing and workforce policy in North America and European Union Partners. Dr Brooke has extensive experience in undertaking aged care and health-related research and in the evaluation of innovative aged care workforce projects (Health Workforce Australia and the Victorian Department of Health, 2012-13). She has expertise in conducting economic costs benefit analyses and is currently undertaking two projects analysing the economic contributions of ageing workforces. Associate Professor Brooke&#39;s research has been based on a range of large scale quantitative and qualitative organisational case studies into older workers, most recently focusing on organisational studies, the retention of older workers in the aged care workforce and studies of retirement pathways and incomes. Contributions have been made to advancing knowledge in quantitative research in large-scale research surveys into retirement intentions. Associate Professor Brooke is currently a Chief Investigator in an Australian Research Council Linkages project, &#39;Retiring Women: Female work-life transitions&#39;which includes research into the career trajectories of older women workers and superannuation. A second ARC Linkages project, &#39;Working Late and the spectre of uselessness&#39;, is focused on the place of older workers in global labour supply. A major focus has been the development of a Workability workforce development framework applied to aged care employment, based on the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health&#39;s multidimensional Workability framework. This framework applies a holistic, cross-sectoral approach to the recruitment and retention of workforces. Associate Professor Brooke was awarded a VicHealth Public Health Fellowship (2006-2011) to undertake a project &#39;Managing Employment Pathways to Reintegrate Older Workers&#39;based on the Finnish Workability framework applied to aged care employment. The project has developed a workforce development framework including training, research benchmarking, interventions and pre and post intervention measurement. The project also received funding from JO &amp;JB Wicking Trust (2008-2011) Trials of more effective means of recruiting, training and retaining aged care professionals. Arising from this demonstration further Workability projects have been implemented across industry sectors focused on the development of innovative organisational retention strategies. Previous research within the Workforce Ageing in the New Economy project funded by the Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada included major reports (www.wane.ca). Earlier contributions include research into age discrimination in employment in Australia published as Age Limits: Age related discrimination in employment affecting workers over 45. Associate Professor Brooke successfully contested the myth that older workers represent an increased cost in human resources in a cost benefit analysis of retaining mature-age workers utilised by a major bank in Australia (See Brooke, L. (2003). Human resource costs and benefits of maintaining a mature-age workforce. International Journal of Manpower, 24, 3, pp 260-283). Between 2003-06 Associate Professor Brooke was Australian Director of the cross-national comparative research study, Workforce Ageing in the New Economy (WANE) project, based at the University of Western Ontario, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC (See www.wane.ca)).

Biography. I am a business academic with an international background and rich experience. Born and raised in Hungary, I completed two masters degrees and gained teaching (economics, small business management), research (innovation, entrepreneurship and national development) and consulting (project and strategic management) experience. I moved to Melbourne in 2006, and enrolled into the PhD programme at Swinburne on an Australian SUPRA scholarship. I have taught marketing, international business and strategy, and have worked on research projects in law, international business and economic development. After completing my PhD in 2010, titled &#39;The Growth of SMEs in the ICT sector&#39;, I continued at Swinburne as a lecturer in International Business. After completing the Graduate Certificate of Teaching and Learning, I started developing a distinct area of specialisation in leadership, economic development and quantitative research methods, and a geographical focus on Central and Eastern Europe. I became adjunct to the Department of Economics, at the Budapest University of Technology, Hungary, as assistant professor, and later at RMIT in Melbourne, as associate PhD supervisor. Currently I am focussing on developing an international research network, to attract research funding, and am working on expanding my portfolio of publications. I actively participate in the life of the Faculty, building industry partnerships, supervising PhD students, supporting my colleagues in research projects and program coordination. Teaching.

Dr Helena Liu is a critical leadership scholar who joined Swinburne Business School in January 2014. She completed her PhD in Organisational Studies in late 2012 at the University of Sydney Business School. Her research focuses on the discursive construction of leadership. This approach has led her to examine the ways in which leaders apologise and account for failure and the social construction of authenticity among banking CEOs during the Global Financial Crisis. Central to her work is a critical disposition towards the gendered, racialised and classed nature of how we have come to understand &#39;leadership.&#39;. Dr Liu is a qualitative researcher who specialises in visual and verbal discourse analysis. She has published in Gender, Work &amp;Organization, Leadership, Journal of Business Ethics, and Management Communication Quarterly, and aspires to publish many, many more articles during her time at Swinburne. Her article on authentic leadership and failure framing was described as &quot;original&quot;by one of the founders of the construct. She is currently researching leadership among Chinese Australians. Please visit her Personal Webpage (link at bottom of page) for more details on current projects and publications. Teaching.

He has established a network of international contacts with senior management of business corporations, government officials and scholars in different parts of the world.

Dr Mohammed is committed to research with a clear understanding and comprehensive knowledge in the area of international business and Islamic studies (particularly Islamic business ethics and Islamic banking).

Swinburne Business School. Department of Leadership and Management. BA (Hons) Physics, University of Stirling, Scotland, Doctor of Philosophy, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. Tel:61 3 9214 4687. Office: BA1102. Email: jdalrymple@swin.edu.au. Biography. John Dalrymple holds a BA (Hons) from the University of Stirling and a PhD from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. Before coming to Australia in 1997, John was a Research Fellow and then Lecturer at the University of Strathclyde before moving to the University of Stirling as a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Head of Department of Management Science. In 1989, along with colleagues, John established the Scottish Quality Management Centre at the University of Stirling to provide a focus for research, commercial activity, consultancy and as a base for the development of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the field of quality management. The Centre worked extensively with the Scottish Enterprise Foundation to support and improve the performance of small and medium-sized companies in Central Scotland. The Centre also played a leading part in the development of quality in public sector organisations and became the largest such Centre in Europe. John was invited to Australia to take up the position of Founding Director of the Centre for Management Quality Research and Professor of Quality Management at RMIT University. John built the Centre into a very productive academic research unit generating significant research output and a number of successful research higher degree completions. John pioneered the use of the UK Benchmarking Index in Australia, a business profile benchmarking instrument that provides a comprehensive set of some eighty measures of performance for small and medium-sized companies. John used the instrument to identify performance improvement opportunities for company operations and worked with companies and partners to improve competitiveness of companies in Northern Metropolitan Melbourne. The instrument has been adopted by the Commonwealth Government Enterprise Connect program as part of their comprehensive business review process for small and medium-sized companies. John attracted over one million pounds sterling in research funding from the UK Science and Engineering Research Council to engage with industry partners in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, a program designed to enable knowledge transfer from academia to industry to improve industrial performance and transfer real understanding of industrial and commercial performance improvement into the academic and lecture theatre environment. Under John&#39;s leadership, the Centre for Management Quality Research at RMIT University attracted some $3million in funding, produced many journal articles, conference papers and research higher degree completions. John and the staff and students of the Centre were regular recipients of &#39;Best Paper&#39;awards at international conferences. He was also recognised by the Asia Pacific Business Excellence Standard Academy with an individual award for excellence in 2006. John is the Editor of Quality Assurance in Education, a journal published by the European academic publishing house, Emerald. John received an RMIT University Award for Research Supervision in 2006 and, in 2010, he supervised four Doctoral Candidates to completion. Research Interests. Small and Medium-sized enterprises.

Between 1997 and 2001, his research findings were cited in 26 different news releases, including newspapers, television and radio.

Both books had numerous reprints. -His research in International Business began with his teaching of the subject in 1981 at Massey University in New Zealand. His initial effort produced a Reader in International Business published by the university. As there was no Australasian text in International Business and with acquired expertise in developing the subject further at Deakin University and Swinburne University of Technology, he co-edited a text titled International Business in 1991 and again published by Longman Cheshire. -With globalisation and the growing importance of Asia in world trade, he produced 2 monographs to cover these emerging areas of interest in business education. Global Business: The New Realignment and Asia in Transition by Massey University in 1999. -In 2003, with the growth of management education and the dearth of case studies in Australia, he co-authored another case study book titled Cases in Management. This book was release in 2002 by Tertiary Press in Melbourne. His contributions in journal publications have followed a similar pattern to other publications. His publication interests are in management generally, and with a growing interest and narrowed focus in leadership and cross-cultural research.

As regulation of the social media activity at schools becomes increasingly hard to maintain in the age of anonymous and semi-anonymous social media apps, the attitudes and practices of teenagers in Australian schools are evolving. Drawing on the work of youth sociologists and social media scholars with an emphasis on platform-specific behavior my thesis explores the impact of school policy on the social media etiquette and informal online behavior protocols of Australian secondary school students. Focusing on the school and students as constituting a multilevel network, this research project explores the resulting interpersonal ties and inter-organisational connections.
