<#--
	Sets HTML encoding as the default for this file only - use <#noescape>...</#noescape> around anything which should not be escaped.
	Note that if you include macros from another file, they are not affected by this and must hand escaping themselves
	Either by using a similar escape block, or ?html escapes inline.
