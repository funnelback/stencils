| Step Number | Action | Feature Demonstrated |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| 1      | Click on <url> |                |
| 2      | Search for water | Tabs will be displayed at the top displaying the various repositories. These can be based on metadata within documents, site's information architecture (IA) or repository type.|
| 3      | Scroll to the bottom of the page | A preview of the <tab> can be found at the bottom underneath the 10 standard results. This feature aims to provide some exploratory insight of content from other tabs. The tab preview also provides a more guided approach for the user to activate various tabs as tabs alone can suffer from user blindness (users simply ignoring tabs as they are not sure of what the search might do). |
