Stencil Hook Scripts
=================

Traditionaly, hook scripts are built either from scratch or simply created from existing hook script through copy-and-paste. This can be troublesome, time consuming (especially as not all consultants are well versed with java/groovy) and error proned.

As part of the Stencils initiative, the hook package aims to provide standard query processing functionality in order to simplify the creation of hook scripts. A few examples of the functionality that will be provided can be found below:

* Custom sorting of facets
* Injecting facets
* Preparing results
* Cleanse and manipulate queries
